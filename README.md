# Modern Portfolio built with Next.js + Chakra UI

I have many things planned for this portfolio like using GitHub API to add some live stuffs, Spotify status, Twitter API, and other free-to-use APIs.

I am also concerned about the design of the website, I want it to look modern and beautiful, since this is just a beginning, I hope other people find it interesting and contribue to the project.
